## Design Accessibility
### Checklist & Resources - 0.3.0

+ Color is not used as the sole method of conveying content or distinguishing visual elements.
+ Text contrast meets AA (4.5:1) requirements. [Check your Palette!](http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/)
+ Alt Text for meaningful graphical interface elements.
+ Label or call to action for controls (buttons, forms). Design as much as possible with visible labels.
+ Annotate known design patterns. (Keyboard Interaction, Roles, States, Properties)
  + [Aria authoring](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#intro) includes states for known patterns.
  + [Button States:](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#button) ‚ÄúWhen the action associated with a button is unavailable, the button has [aria-disabled](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-disabled) set to true.‚Äù
+ Confirm that you have multiple ways to interact with the UI (Keyboard, touch, and mouse)
  + There is a list of accordions. User can open an accordion with by touch, click, or keypress of enter. They can navigate to other tabs by pressing arrow up / down.
+ Annotate Screen Reader Interactions for [live content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) such as expected data values, instructions, or required fields. Examples:
    + Assignment displays grade. Student answers a question which updates their grade. Grade element set to `aria-live="polite"`
    + User encounters a warning modal. Warning set to `aria-live="alert"`
+ Tab order is identified and properly managed on page and in modal windows.
  + Can the user Skip to Content?
  + Focus States are defined: [a11ycasts Focus Ring!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilj2P5-5CjI)
+ Annotate with the [HTML semantic elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
  + Indicate headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.)
  + Buttons perform an action: ex. Save, Done, Apply, Preview
  + Links cause change of focus: ex Open a page in a new tab, take you to an anchor somewhere else on the page.
+ Annotate the semantic [Input Types.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)
+ Indicate [Landmarks](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#landmark):
  + [General Principles of Landmark Design](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#general-principles-of-landmark-design)
  + When possible, define landmarks with HTML sectioning: `aside`, `footer`, `header`, `main`, `nav`, `section`.
  + Otherwise use appropriate aria-role
  + Main landmark should have an `h1` (can be placed in banner)
  + Each navigation landmark should have an `h2` (can be offscreen)
    + If there are more than one navigation landmarks, use `aria-labelledby` to reference the `h2`
  + `footer` / `contentinfo` should have an `h2`: [Aria & HTML5 examples](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/contentinfo.html)
  + Each `aside` / `complementary` landmark should have an `h2` (can be offscreen)
    + If there are more than one `complementary` landmarks, use `aria-labelledby` to reference the `h2`. [Example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/navigation.html)
  + Each region landmark should have an `h2` ‚Äì `h6` (can be offscreen)
    + If there are more than one `region` landmarks, use `aria-labelledby` to reference the heading element
