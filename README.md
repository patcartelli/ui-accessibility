## Design Accessibility Guidelines

### Design
+ Color is not used as the sole method of conveying meaning or distinguishing visual elements.
+ Do not rely on visuals or sound to indicate important instructions for operating content.
    + **Incorrect:** Only uses sound to indicate success or only uses color to indicate success.
    + **Correct:** Uses both a sound or color as well as a label to indicate success.
+ Text meets AA (4.5:1) color contrast requirements.
  + [Check your Color Contrast!](http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/)
+ Every call to action (such as buttons, form elements, etc.) must be meaningfully named.
    + Design as much as possible with visible labels.
    + If you must include a meaningful graphical interface element without a label, alt text is required to describe the function of this element.
+ Alternative text (alt text) is provided for meaningful content images and graphical interface elements.
  + Meaningful graphical interface elements can be things that aren't actually images, such as font icons, image-like unicode (e.g. emoji), or stylized CSS.
  + Alt text for meaningful content images should be provided by Editorial.
  + Decorative images do not need alt text.
  + [Alt Text Basics](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/#basics)
  + [Accessibility: Image Alt text best practices](https://support.siteimprove.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115000013031-Accessibility-Image-Alt-text-best-practices)

### Annotations
+ **Documentation Reference** - Reference the [ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#intro) for known design patterns. These guidelines includes descriptive annotations for keyboard interaction, roles, and states.
  + Confirm that keyboard, touch, and mouse are supported to provide users multiple ways to interact with the interface.
  + E.g. In a list of accordions, the user can open an accordion with by touch, click, or keypress of enter. User can navigate to other accordions by pressing arrow up / down.
+ **Aria-live**- Annotate screen reader interactions for live content such as expected data values, instructions, or required fields. Examples available here: [MDN - ARIA Live Regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions)
+ **Focus Indication** - Design Focus States to help users navigate and understand where they are.
  + Is "Skip to Content" available and first in the tab order?
  + Tab order is identified and properly managed on the page and in modal windows.
  + Video: [a11ycasts Focus Ring!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilj2P5-5CjI)
+ Annotate using the appropriate [HTML semantic elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
  + Indicate headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.)
    + E.g. "Document title H1"
  + Annotate the semantic [Input Types.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) Examples: [Checkbox, email, password, button.](https://codepen.io/sh0ji/pen/VebrBM)
  * Buttons perform an action such as "Save" or ‚ÄúApply.‚Äù
  * Links cause change of focus: Opens a page in a new tab or takes you to an anchor elsewhere on the page.
+ Indicate [Landmarks](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#landmark) ‚Äî [General Principles of Landmark Design](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#general-principles-of-landmark-design)
  + Always define the [main](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_lh_main) content container if it exists.
  + Define [other landmark regions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#landmark-roles) in your wireframes wherever possible.
      + `main` landmark should have an `h1` (can be placed in banner)
      + `navigation` landmarks should have an `h2` (can be offscreen)
      + `footer` should have an `h2` (can be offscreen)
      + Each `aside` landmark should have an `h2` (can be offscreen)
      + Each `region` landmark should have an `h2` ‚Äì `h6` (can be offscreen)
